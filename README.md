Introduction

As a deep learning researcher, one of the difficult steps of our job is to train models, for example in my projects on emotion recognition, to train a CNN model using Fer2013 dataset which has more than 37,000 images via a CUP Core i5, I should forget a whole day of my time (training and testing) it's because we decided to use another solution, GPU!

In the following steps which were tested on a Dell laptop with the configuration below, the result is exactly what we wanted. training the model with the same dataset only took 40 minutes!
```
GPU: Nvidia Geforce RTX 2060 with 6GB memory 
CPU: Core i7  with 12MB cache 
RAM: 16GB DDR4 

```
